	      As a member of the <a href="http://kepler.nasa.gov/Mission/team/">Kepler/K2 mission</a> 
              team and former lead postdoc for the 
              <a href="http://csi2264.ipac.caltech.edu/">Coordinated Synoptic Investigation
       	      of NGC 2264</a>, my current research aims to
              understand the relationship between young stellar object ("YSO")
              variability and the physics operating at the stellar
              surface and in the surrounding environment. I am particularly
              interested in using time domain studies to map the structure of circumstellar
              disks at 0.1-1 AU, and to test magnetospheric accretion models. 
	      Carrying out high precision photometric monitoring at a variety of wavelengths from both ground (e.g., CTIO
              1.0-meter and Palomar 60-inch telescopes) and
              space-based telescopes (e.g., Spitzer Space Telescope, the French CoRoT satellite, and 
              the Kepler telecope), my collaborators and I
              have uncovered hundreds of variable YSOs, many of them
              displaying erratic brightness fluctuations at the 10-100%
              level. A number of these light curves have defied
              explanation; see the example at right, in which a YSO
              underwent eclipse-like dips for five nights in a
              row. Could this be the signature of a pre-planetary dust blob? I have
              compiled and posted a <a href="sigmaori.html">collection of light
              curves</a> of 3-5 million-year-old Sigma Orionis
              members from my <a
              href="http://iopscience.iop.org/0067-0049/191/2/389/">2010
              ground-based study</a> of that cluster.
	      <p> With the help of the CSI team, I have developed a <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/1538-3881/147/4/82/"> 
              new framework for the classification of optical and infrared variability</a>
              and am now connecting it with physical mechanisms. The overarching goal
              of this work is to use time series monitoring to better understand star-disk
              interaction as well as inner disk structure and dust
              properties in the terrestrial planet formation zone.

			  Time series photometry has been an important tool for my work on both the analysis of young
			  star variability and the search for substellar pulsation. Every telescope and CCD camera has
			  its own quirks, which introduce systematic errors into the photometry. As part of my PhD
			  thesis, I developed pipelines for the production of high-precision differential optical and
			  infrared photometry. For my <a
		      href="http://iopscience.iop.org/0067-0049/191/2/389/">
		      ground-based work </a> involving the CTIO 1.0m telescope and
			  Palomar 60-inch telescope, I combined image subtraction techniques with variable aperture
			  photometry to generate light curves with precisions to less than 3 millimagnitudes on 1-2
			  week timescales. The red dots in the top
		      plot at right show how this method offers
		      improvement over standard image subtraction
		      (blue) and fixed-aperture photometry (black).

			<p> Precision photometry with Spitzer/IRAC is complicated by the varying
			  intra-pixel sensitivity of this instrument, which is folded into photometry as the telescope
			  pointing wobbles slightly every 40 minutes (previously, 60). Removing the resulting
			  systematics (both a 40-minute oscillation, and a longer term trend) without compromising real
			  stellar variability is a tricky business! I developed a
			  <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011ApJ...741....9C">method to correct IRAC light curves </a>
			  by minimizing the pixel-phase signal in
		      frequency space, using periodograms. The before
		      and after light curves are shown at right.
			</p>
                       <p> K2 data has a similar issue with systematics due to its pointing instability; we are applying
                          similar techniques to detrend the light curves from that mission.

		      In 2005, Palla &amp; Baraffe proposed that brown dwarfs and very low mass stars young enough to be burning Deuterium
		      might be subject to an oscillatory instability on few-hour timescales. This was an exciting prospect, as
		      the physics of pulsation could be potentially used to probe the interiors of these objects, providing
		      information inaccessible via other observational methods. There are currently no known forms of stellar
		      oscillation observable in the very-low-mass regime (apart from Jupiter!). Thanks to many dedicated
		      photometric and spectroscopic surveys of young clusters, there are now hundreds of catalogued brown dwarfs and
		      very-low-mass stars in the 1-5 million year age range, many of which have stellar parameters overlapping
		      Palla &amp; Baraffeâ€™s instability strip. For my PhD thesis, I developed a photometric monitoring campaign to search
		      for low-amplitude periodic variability in young brown dwarfs and very low mass stars using meter-class
		      telescopes from both the ground (Palomar &amp; CTIO) and space (Spitzer &amp; HST). The resulting high-precision,
		      high-cadence time-series photometry targeted the four young clusters IC 348, Sigma Orionis, Chamaeleon I,
		      and Upper Scorpius, and it achieved sensitivity to periodic oscillations with photometric amplitudes down
		      to several millimagnitudes.

			This unprecedented variability census probed timescales ranging from

		      establishment of a lower limit for the timescale of periodic photometric variability in young low-mass and
		      substellar objects, an extension of the rotation period distribution to the brown dwarf regime, as well as
		      insights into the connection between variability and circumstellar disks in the Sigma Orionis and Chamaeleon

			  Over the past 10 years, hundreds of planets have now been discovered orbiting
			  nearby stars in our Galaxy. I enjoyed participating in the Harvard College Research Program
			  as an undergrad, during the time that these extrasolar worlds were first being discovered.
			  With Dimitar Sasselov, I generated stellar evolution tracks for planet-bearing stars,
			  showing how <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002ApJ...569..451C">theoretical models</a>
			  can help pin down the radii of transiting planets. It was noted early on that stars hosting
			  so-called &quot;hot Jupiters&quot; exhibit higher surface metallicities than random samples of field
			  stars. One hypothesis was that this enhanced metallicity was the direct result of rocky
			  planet material falling into the star and mixing within its convection zone. I created
			  <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005ApJ...622..704C">stellar interior and evolution models</a>
			  to explore this effect. With Douglas Gough, I further showed that a metal-enhanced convection
			  zone maybe produce a detectable signal in the frequency differences measured for solar-like
			  oscillations, using the techniques of asteroseismology. My M.Phil. thesis</a> from
			  the University of Cambridge details this prediction. Today, primordial effects are the
			  favored hypothesis for the high metallicities in giant planet hosts &#45; but it was nevertheless
			  a very fun problem to work on!
